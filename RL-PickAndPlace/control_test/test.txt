1. Simulation Time Step (dt): MuJoCo's physics engine operates at a fixed, small time step. Simulation frequency is 1/dt.
2. Control Frequency: The control frequency, or policy update frequency, is often lower than the simulation frequency. 
   This means that a control action might be applied for multiple simulation steps before a new action is computed.
3. Action Persistence: How many simulation steps a single control action persists before a new one is applied. 
   If the simulation time step is dt and an action persists for k steps, the control frequency is 1 / (k * dt).


In PointMaze_UMaze-v3 env:
control frequency is specified as f = 10Hz in Gymnasium-Robotics Documentation by default.  
dt is determined by env.unwrapped.model.opt.timestep parameter, which is 0.01.  [flexible]
k = 10 can be inferred.  [fixed]

1 / (k * dt) = 1 / (10 * 0.01) = 1 / 0.1 = 10 = control frequency (checked!)


In FetchPickAndPlaceDense-v4 env:
control frequency is specified as f = 25Hz in Gymnasium-Robotics Documentation by default.
dt is determined by env.unwrapped.model.opt.timestep parameter, which is 0.002.  [flexible]
k = 20 is stated in Gymnasium-Robotics Documentation.  [fixed]

(k * dt) = (20 * 0.002) = 0.04 = env.unwrapped.dt
1 / (k * dt) = 1 / 0.04 = 25 = control frequency (checked!)
